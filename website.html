          <h5><b>New York City, United States of American</b></h5>
              <p>
                What i would like to experience is the snow weather as the city gets about 15 times more snow than the South Pole every year (this shouldn't be too surprising though because Antarctica is a desert and therefore receives very little precipitation).
                I would also like to visit the Central Park in the city to take more lovely pictures.
                The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: La Liberté éclairant le monde) is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York City, in the United States. The copper statue, designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, a French sculptor, was built by Gustave Eiffel and dedicated on October 28, 1886. It was a gift to the United States from the people of France. The statue is of a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess, who bears a torch and a tabula ansata (a tablet evoking the law) upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776. A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue is an icon of freedom and of the United States, and was a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad.

                    	Heading west, on the other side of Dock Road above the car park, is the 1894 Time Ball
                    	Tower; its purpose was to act as an accurate reference for ships' navigators who set their clocks as the ball on the roof fell. Correct time was vital for navigators to be able to determine
                    	precise longitude. Beside the tower is a 110-year-old dragon tree,
                    	Dracaeno draco
                    	, from the Canary Islands, and next to the tree is the original
                    	harbour master's residence
                    	(1860).
